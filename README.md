# Terraform 

## What is Terraform?
* **Terraform** is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. 
* It allows users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a high-level configuration language called **HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)**. Good balance and understandble from machines and humans. 
* **Terraform** manages infrastructure across a wide range of service providers such as AWS, Azure, GCP, VMware, and even on-premise environments.
* **Terraform** is an orchestration tool (infrastructure provisioning tool - creates, deploys, manages and destroys the infrastructure).
* Terraform see infrastructure as **immutable**. 

### What is Terraform used for?
* Terraform is used to automate the process of creating, updating, and versioning infrastructure. 
* By using code, it allows teams to manage infrastructure resources such as virtual machines, networking, and storage in a declarative way. This ensures that infrastructure is always consistent across environments.

## Why use Terraform? The Benefits

### Key Benefits of Terraform:
1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Treat infrastructure the same way as application code, using version control and best practices.
2. **Multi-Cloud**: Terraform is cloud-agnostic and can manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers, making it a powerful tool for multi-cloud deployments.
3. **Declarative Syntax**: You define the end state of your infrastructure, and Terraform figures out the necessary steps to reach that state.
4. **Automation**: Automates repetitive manual tasks related to infrastructure management, reducing human error.
5. **Modular and Reusable Code**: Create reusable modules for infrastructure components, enabling easier scaling and management.
6. **State Management**: Terraform stores infrastructure states, which enables you to plan changes and apply only the necessary updates to your environment.
7. **Cloud Agnostic**: Can deploy to any cloud provider because it uses different cloud providers. Each provider maintains their own plugins (e.g. Azure has an Azure plugin in Terraform that will interface with the API of Azure).  
8. **Free?**: We can use it for free commercially. Terraform cannot be used to create a competing product.
9. **Open-Source and Easy to use**.

## Alternatives to Terraform
There are several alternatives to Terraform in the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) space, including:

1. **AWS CloudFormation**: AWS-specific tool for provisioning infrastructure on AWS.
2. **Ansible**: Primarily a configuration management tool but can also manage infrastructure provisioning.
3. **Pulumi**: Similar to Terraform, but allows you to write infrastructure code using general-purpose programming languages (e.g., TypeScript, Python).
4. **Chef/Puppet**: Configuration management tools that can manage infrastructure but are more focused on provisioning applications and environments.
5. **Google Cloud Deployment Manager**: Google Cloud-specific infrastructure provisioning tool.

## Who is Using Terraform in the Industry?
Terraform is widely adopted across industries, from small startups to large enterprises, due to its flexibility and multi-cloud capabilities. Some of the industries using Terraform include:

- **Technology companies** (e.g., Slack, Uber, and Shopify) for managing cloud infrastructure.
- **Financial services** for secure and scalable infrastructure deployment.
- **Retail and E-commerce** for provisioning dynamic infrastructure at scale.
- **Media and Entertainment** for managing large-scale content delivery systems.

## What is Orchestration in IaC?
* **Orchestration** in Infrastructure as Code refers to the process of coordinating and managing multiple components of infrastructure (e.g., networks, servers, databases) to work together harmoniously. 
* It involves defining the relationships and dependencies between various resources and automating their provisioning and configuration.

### How Does Terraform Act as an Orchestrator?
Terraform acts as an orchestrator by:
1. Defining the desired end state of your infrastructure in code.
2. Automatically determining the correct order in which to provision, modify, or destroy resources, respecting dependencies (e.g., creating a database before deploying an application).
3. Applying changes in a controlled and predictable way, using its built-in plan and apply workflow.

## Best Practice: Supplying AWS Credentials to Terraform

### AWS Credentials Lookup Order in Terraform:
Terraform checks for AWS credentials in the following order of precedence (if it can't find from the one it will check the nexxt one on the list):
1. **Environment Variables**: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
    * You would need to set up system variables under **Edit the system environment variables**.
2. **AWS Credentials File**: Located at `~/.aws/credentials`.
3. **Instance Profile**: For EC2 instances running in AWS with an IAM role attached.
4. **Explicit Access in Terraform Config**: Credentials provided directly in the Terraform configuration file (not recommended).

### Best Practice to Supply AWS Credentials:
The recommended approach for securely supplying AWS credentials is through **environment variables** or by using **AWS IAM roles** (for EC2 instances). These methods reduce the chances of exposing sensitive credentials.

1. **Use Environment Variables**: Use `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` as environment variables to provide access.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-id"
     export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"
     ```

2. **Use AWS Profiles**: Use profiles defined in the AWS credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`) and reference them using the `profile` parameter in Terraform.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     provider "aws" {
       profile = "my-aws-profile"
     }
     ```

3. **Use IAM Roles**: For EC2 instances, assign IAM roles with the necessary permissions. Terraform will automatically detect and use the role without the need for explicit credentials.

### How AWS Credentials Should **Never** Be Passed to Terraform:
- **Do not hard-code credentials** directly in the Terraform files (`.tf` files). This can lead to accidental exposure in version control systems like GitHub.
- **Avoid committing `~/.aws/credentials`** or environment variables with credentials into source control.

## Why Use Terraform for Different Environments (Production, Testing, etc.)
* Using Terraform to manage multiple environments (such as **production**, **staging**, and **testing**) allows you to maintain consistent infrastructure across these environments while also adapting to their unique requirements.
* Developers using different environments will cause problems. Having a consistent environment and then that matching environment is used throughout the different environments. 
    * All the dependencies should match. 
    * **Production environment** needs to be scalable so you have more load than **Testing**. 

### Benefits:
1. **Consistency**: Ensures that each environment is created with the same infrastructure code, reducing drift and errors.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: You can use different **Terraform workspaces** or separate configuration files for each environment, ensuring that changes to one environment do not affect others.
3. **Version Control**: You can track infrastructure changes for each environment using a version control system (e.g., Git).
4. **Testing**: Test infrastructure changes in staging or testing environments before applying them to production.

By using Terraform, organizations can automate the provisioning and teardown of environments, enabling faster deployment cycles and reducing human error.

# Steps to install terraform 
1) Go on the terraform website and select the **Windows AMD64**.
2) This will download as a zip you can then extract this and add it to a `C:\my-cmd-line-tools`.
3) Search on the search below **Edit System Environment Variables** and add a PATH env variable with the path to the terraform file.
